<p class="text">This is a rather simple sauce that is perfect for beginners. That doesn't take away from its taste though. It is sweet,
    spicy, and has some sourness from the vinegar.
</p>
<p class="text">It takes about 5-10 mintues to make though its recommended that if you're
    not in a rush to try to cook it for another 5 minutes to let the flavors mingle longer.</p>
