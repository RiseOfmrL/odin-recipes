<p class="text">This is my favorite and most experienced way to fry chicken. If you want flavorful chicken, I'd recommend marinating it in the buttermilk mixture for at least a few hours,
    but up to a day before you end up cooking it. This'll make the chicken juicier, more tender, and more flavorful.

<h2 class="text">Ingredients</h2>
<h3 class="text">Marinade</h3>
<ul class="list">

<li>Chicken Tenders or Thighs</li>
<li>2 Teaspoons of Black Pepper</li>
<li>1 Teaspoon of Salt</li>
<li>1 Teaspoon of Paprika</li>
<li>1 Teaspoon of White Pepper</li>
<li>2 Fresh Sprigs of Rosemary</li>
<li>1/2 Teaspoon of Ground Thyme</li>
<li>1/2 Teaspoon of Dried Oregano</li>
<li>1/2 Teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper</li>
<li>2 Cups of Buttermilk</li>

</ul>

<h3 class="text">Seasoned Flour</h3>

<ul class="list">
<li>2 Cups of All Purpose Flour</li>
<li>1 Teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper</li>
<li>1 Teaspoon of Garlic Powder</li>
<li>1 Teaspoon of White Pepper</li>
<li>1 Teaspoon of Onion Powder</li>
<li>1/4 Cup of Breadcrumbs</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text">Steps</h2>
<ol class="list">

    <li>First toss your chicken in a bowl with all of the herbs and spices in the marinade minus the buttermilk.</li>
    <li>Add in at least 2 cups of buttermilk or until the chicken is completely covered.</li>
    <li>Cover the bowl and let them rest and marinate for a few hours to an entire day.</li>
    <li>After marinating you should make your seasoned flour mixture. Add in a tablespoon of the buttermilk mixture from the chicken as well.</li>
    <li>Whisk all of the flour mixture together thoroughly</li>
    <li>Take out your chicken one at a time and press the chicken into the flour mixture with some strengh behind it. Make sure all of the chicken is covered.</li>
    <li>Heat up a large pan or fryer and heat the oil until its around 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li>Add in the chicken in the oil (placing away from you) and fry them for about 7 to 10 minutes, flip, and then do the same for the other side or until golden brown.</li>
    <li>When finished let it rest on a raised cooling rack so it stays crispy.</li>
